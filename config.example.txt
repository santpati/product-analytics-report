# Email Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual credentials

# SMTP Server settings (default is Gmail)
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587

# Your email credentials
SENDER_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password-here

# For Gmail, you'll need to use an App Password:
# 1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
# 2. Enable 2-Step Verification if not already enabled
# 3. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
# 4. Generate an app password for "Mail"
# 5. Use that password here

# Alternatively, use Cisco's SMTP server:
# SMTP_SERVER=outbound.cisco.com
# SMTP_PORT=25
